     FV	=	future value

     PV	=	present value

     r	=	annual interest rate

     n	=	number of periods interest held

## present Value
   - Formula

     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PV=FV \frac{1}{(1%2Br)^{n}}">

     PV	=	present value
     
     FV	=	future value
     
     r	=	annual interest rate
     
     n	=	number of periods interest held
