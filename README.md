# Basic Finance Functions

Following Basic Finace Function that is implemented in this file in Python.

## Future Value
   - Formula

     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge FV= PV*(1%2Br)^n">

     FV	=	future value

     PV	=	present value

     r	=	annual interest rate

     n	=	number of periods interest held

## present Value
   - Formula

     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PV=FV \frac{1}{(1%2Br)^{n}}">

     PV	=	present value
     
     FV	=	future value
     
     r	=	annual interest rate
     
     n	=	number of periods interest held
     

## present value of Annuity

 ### ordinary Annuity
  - Formula
  
    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge FVA= \frac{Pmt}{i}*(1-\frac{1}{(1%2Bi)^n})">
  
    pmt  =  periodic payments
     
    i    = annual interest rate
  
    n	=	number of periods
   
 ### Due Annuity
 
   - Formula

 ### Due Annuity
 
   - Formula
   
## Effective Annual Rate

   - Formula
 
     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge EAR= (1%2B  \frac{i}m)^m-1"> 

      i = annual interest rate

      m = number of compounding periods
   
## value of perpetuity

   - Formula
   
     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PV= \frac{pmt}{i}">
     
     pmt  =  periodic payments
     
     i    = annual interest rate
