# Basic Finance Functions

Following Basic Finace Function that is implemented in this file in Python.

## Future Value
   - Formula

      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge FV= PV*(1%2Br)^n">

      FV	=	future value

      PV	=	present value

      r	=	annual interest rate

      n	=	number of periods interest held

## present Value
   - Formula

      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PV=FV \frac{1}{(1%2Br)^{n}}">

      PV	=	present value
     
      FV	=	future value
     
      r	=	annual interest rate
     
      n	=	number of periods interest held
     

## present value of Annuity

 ### ordinary Annuity
  - Formula
  
      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PVA= \frac{Pmt}{i}*(1-\frac{1}{(1%2Bi)^n})">
  
      pmt  =  periodic payments
     
      i    = annual interest rate
  
      n	=	number of periods
   
 ### Due Annuity
 
   - Formula
   
      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PVA= \frac{Pmt}{i}*(1-\frac{1}{(1%2Bi)^n})*(1%2Bi)">
  
      pmt  =  periodic payments
     
      i    = annual interest rate
  
      n	=	number of periods
   
## Future Value of annuity

 ### ordinary Annuity

   - Formula
   
      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge FVA= \frac{Pmt}{i}*({(1%2Bi)^n}-1)">
  
      pmt  =  periodic payments
     
      i    = annual interest rate
  
      n	=	number of periods
   
 ### Due Annuity
 
   - Formula
   
      <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge FVA= \frac{Pmt}{i}*({(1%2Bi)^n}-1)*(1%2Bi)">
      
      pmt  =  periodic payments
     
      i    = annual interest rate
  
      n	=	number of periods
   
## Effective Annual Rate

   - Formula
 
     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge EAR= (1%2B  \frac{i}m)^m-1"> 

      i = annual interest rate

      m = number of compounding periods
   
## value of perpetuity

   - Formula
   
     <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Huge PV= \frac{pmt}{i}">
     
     pmt  =  periodic payments
     
     i    = annual interest rate
